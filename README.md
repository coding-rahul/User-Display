# User-Display
 Assingment_Submission
The project is made with React in a Functional Programming like approach.
Here I create json server that file pasted in User-Display repositories and I host json server locally in our system to stor the user data,
Firstly go to json_Api1 directory in Cmd.Then we need to start json server using
Command line json-server --watch data.json --port 12345 
Run npm to install packages (just a first time). 
Running the project go to project directory.
run npm start(it runs the app in the development mode and opens http://localhost:3000 automatically to view in the browser).
